Still should try and match J&H's results, also to make sure it's correct

Should get some error bars

analyze the difference between the data which is sort of equilibrated, and the data which is definitely equilibrated
^^there actually is a difference, which perhaps raises the question of could
it equilibrate more

looks like two slopes, on the log-log plot of the log of acorr
but should go to longer times? to verify this, since it looks like the second line starts at larger t
longer times means another order of magnitude, so like 1000-3000
wont make a difference to get state, but need to get fast autocorr calculation for this

maybe that point happens further out for lower T
maybe identifying where that happens, ie glassy behavior up to certain t which is a function of T, is interesting

also could be a function of size; could be an artifact of simulation
so we can try to extrapolate and say the real system does have glassy behavior
^^in this case important to get cellsize=12 working

wait, slope is actually DECREASING? or is it the two lines thing
slope on log-log of log(-acorr) goes from ~0.7 to ~0.4. never near 1, seems to
be decreasing with time

really make the trend with each simulation parameter (size, T) clear

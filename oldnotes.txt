Still should try and match J&H's results, also to make sure it's correct

Should get some error bars

analyze the difference between the data which is sort of equilibrated, and the data which is definitely equilibrated
^^there actually is a difference, which perhaps raises the question of could
it equilibrate more

looks like two slopes, on the log-log plot of the log of acorr
but should go to longer times? to verify this, since it looks like the second line starts at larger t
longer times means another order of magnitude, so like 1000-3000
wont make a difference to get state, but need to get fast autocorr calculation for this

maybe that point happens further out for lower T
maybe identifying where that happens, ie glassy behavior up to certain t which is a function of T, is interesting

also could be a function of size; could be an artifact of simulation
so we can try to extrapolate and say the real system does have glassy behavior
^^in this case important to get cellsize=12 working

wait, slope is actually DECREASING? or is it the two lines thing
slope on log-log of log(-acorr) goes from ~0.7 to ~0.4. never near 1, seems to
be decreasing with time

really make the trend with each simulation parameter (size, T) clear

decide what plots to look at. should be: 1. log(acorr), and 2. log-log of
log(-acorr)

actually there is a lower bound on the acorr, determined by the size of the
system. goes as 1/N, for us, only trustworthy for greater than 10^-3
actually, get confirmation on this


seems I am seeing stretched exponential behavior, but IS IT RIGHT????

only place could be wrong in MC code is in easyflip energy calculation
(checked)

or, the ewald calculation
here the fact that real and rec are balancing across alpha tells us something
and the code is simple now.
Last thing: NN calculation. should i==j==k==0 indeed?
If tiling the lattice in this way is ok, and FCC is still Bravais so it should
be, then it is right. I've done all I can.


Now efforts have to split up into 2 branches:
--check if the code is right, done
--prepare some stuff to show results clearly

now redid ewald. dont see glassy behavior, ie it is simple exponential

how to introduce impurities?
variable couplings, of J or D? or both?
